                <h2 class="h-secondary center">What Are The Causes Of Aggression ?</h2>
                <p class="center">Social Psychologists have explored the issue of 
                    Aggression for several years, and have come up with the
                    following views about the causes of Aggression - <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1) Inborn Tendency :
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Aggressiveness is an 
                    inborn tendency among human beings ( as it is in 
                    animals) . Biologically, this inborn tendency may 
                    be meant for self - defence .</p>
                    <br>
                    2) Physiological Mechanisms :
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Aggression
                        could also be indirectly triggered by
                        physiological mechanisms, especially by
                        the activation of certain parts of the
                        brain that play a role in emotional
                        experience . </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">A general physiological
                    state of arousal, or feeling activated,
                    might often be expressed in the form of
                    aggression . There could be several
                    factors that cause arousal . </p>
                    <br>
                    3) Child - Rearing :
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The way an individual is
                    brought up often influences her / his
                    aggressiveness .</p>
                    <br>
                    4) Frustration :
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Aggression is an
                        expression, and consequence of
                        frustration, that is an emotional state that
                        arises when a person is prevented from
                        reaching a goal, or attaining an object
                        that he / she wants .</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The person may be very 
                        close to the goal, and yet does not attain it . It 
                        has been found that people in frustrated situations
                        show more aggression than those who are not 
                        frustrated .</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Reducing Aggression : Some Stratergies</h2>
                <p class="center">Some of the remedies suggested for
                    curbing aggression are
                    described below - 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1) Parents and teachers should be
                    specially careful not to encourage or
                    reward aggression in any form . The use
                    of punishment to bring about discipline
                    also needs to be changed .
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2) Opportunities to observe and imitate
                    the behaviour of aggressive models
                    should be reduced drastically .
                    Portraying aggression as heroic
                    behaviour should be particularly
                    avoided, because this 
                    may set the stage for learning through observation .
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3) Poverty and social injustice may be a
                    prominent cause of aggression, because
                    they can cause frustration in certain
                    sections of society . Implementing social
                    justice and equality in society may help
                    in reducing frustration levels and
                    thereby curb aggressive tendencies at
                    least to some extent .
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4) Yoga and Mind relaxing actions should be done to 
                    attain inner peace and reduce aggression as well .
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5) Apart from these strategies, at the level
                    of the community or society, it is
                    important to inculcate a positive
                    attitude towards peace . We should not
                    only reduce aggression, but should also 
                    actively develop and maintain peace .</p>
